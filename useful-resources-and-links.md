Below we have provided a list of useful resources and links that you
might find useful when designing, developing and testing your
internet-based interventions.

please share them with us in the

## Websites

#### [LifeGuide Community Website](http://www.lifeguideonline.org)

All resources for developing an intervention with LifeGuide can be found
on the LifeGuide Community website. This site includes:

-   the authoring tool,
-   publications from the LifeGuide team,
-   intervention demos
-   and details of how you can upload your own interventions for:
    -   discussing with your research team,
    -   testing with end-users
    -   and for launching your finished intervention on the LifeGuide
        Server.

#### [The Health of the Net Foundation](http://www.hon.ch/)

The reliability of information online is an important issue to consider
when viewing and developing interventions relating to people’s health.
This website details all you need to know to ensure your health
intervention meets recommendations for being reliable and useful for
end-users. You can check your intervention against their checklist to
ensure it meets their [HON
principles](https://www.hon.ch/cgi-bin/HONcode/Inscription/site_evaluation.pl?language=en&userCategory=individuals)

#### Web Accessibility

The following two links are useful for ensuring that your interventions
meet the requirements for being accessible to all of your end-users
including people with disabilities.

-   [Web accessibility Initiative](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)
-   [Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and Web
    Accessibility](http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-accessibility/uk-website-legal-requirements.shtml)

#### Website Usability

The [Usability.Gov website](http://www.usability.gov/index.html) has
everything you need to ensure your intervention is useful and usable for
your end-users. E.g. thinking about the purpose and goals of the site,
things to think about when writing for the web, and methods for checking
and testing the usability of a site,

#### Website Credibility

Follow [The Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab’s Web Credibility
Project](http://credibility.stanford.edu/). In particular, you can
follow their ten useful guidelines for making your online intervention
credible.

#### Images

The following websites give access to hundreds of royalty and therefore
copyright-free images that you can include in your interventions. Many
images are also free to download whereas others require a small fee.

Images can also be sourced from Microsoft PowerPoint. Alternatively, if
you cannot find the image you want on any stock photography website but
have found an image on another person’s website it is advisable to
e-mail them for permission before using it in your own site.

#### How people read websites
